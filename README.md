This project was developed as a final project for a full stack development course. The purpose of this project was to enhance our learning experience and to apply the skills and knowledge we acquired during the course.

The created application allows users to input basic information such as their name, email, and Coursera ID. The application is built using Node.js, which is a powerful server-side JavaScript runtime environment. It is designed to be easy to use and intuitive, even for those who are new to Node.js.

To get started with the application, you will need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Once you have Node.js installed, you can clone the project from this GitHub repository and install the required dependencies. After that, you can start the application and begin using it to input your basic information.
